WoW 3.3.5 addon. Kader's PlateBuffs - AwesomeWotlk mod.

Fork of https://github.com/bkader/PlateBuffs_WoTLK

Changes: AwesomeWotlk Edition for better aura detect and little more options. See https://github.com/FrostAtom/awesome_wotlk

Potentially updated, fixed the bug where time-infinite auras (like flags on Warsong Gulch/Arathi Basin) weren't displaying, a mistake made by the author (Kader).
I haven't noticed any fake auras on nameplates while testing.
The difference from the default versions of PlateBuffs circulating on the internet: thanks to the AwesomeWotlk library, it works by GUID, so when a nameplate appears on screen after being hidden, the auras show up instantly. 
Additionally, there wonâ€™t be any duplicate auras on nameplates with the same name.
The "watch combatlog" and "save player guid" options are no longer needed when using awesomewotlk.

I also added some options:
