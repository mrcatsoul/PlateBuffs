WoW 3.3.5 addon. Kader's PlateBuffs - AwesomeWotlk mod. Fork of: https://github.com/bkader/PlateBuffs_WoTLK

Changes: 
- Now the code uses functions from the AwesomeWotlk library, we have nameplate tokens(UnitIDs), and thanks to this, their exact GUIDs. See: https://github.com/FrostAtom/awesome_wotlk
- Potentially updated, fixed the bug where time-infinite auras (like flags on Warsong Gulch/Arathi Basin) weren't displaying.
- The options 'watch combatlog' and 'save player guid' are no longer needed when using AwesomeWotlk, which may improve performance.
- New options.
